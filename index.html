    <div class="css-classes">
        <p>One of my goals is to improve my spoken French by moving to France.</p>

        <h2>Preparation List</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Money</b> save on unnecessary expenses by only buying necessities</li>
            <li><b>French classes</b> get one on one French lessons or check out an app to improve before going</li>
            <li><b>Other resources</b> search the web to find other resources that will help</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Where should I move? City or Countryside?</h2>
        <p id="number-one"> There are pros and cons of living in the city versus living in the countryside. In Paris, for instance, more people speak English and are used to tourists. Therefore, they would speak to me predominately in English once they know that I don't speak French. A pro, however, is that I wouldn't need a car in Paris and I would be able to be more independent. In contrast, I would need a car in the countryside and that would be an added expense. However, there are more people who do not speak French in those areas and the likelihood of me having only French interactions, would be higher since I would be forced to understand them speaking and I would have to reply to them in French. Therefore, it seems like the countryside would fit my objective of moving to France in the first place--to improve my French.</p>
